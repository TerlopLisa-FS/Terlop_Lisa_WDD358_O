üì¢ Weekly Stand Up Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week

Week 1: Week one I worked with github using feature branch workflow, creating a project board, researching how to build an api and learning how to create a DB diagram. I struggled with the DB diagram since I am building a project that isn't coded yet but I could have spent more time researching the front end to see more of what the functionality I am looking for was and that would have helped. I strugggled with time management and keeping up with my Github project board but I have found solutions so this won't happen in the future.

Week 2: Coming soon...

Week 3 Stay tuned, this stand up is coming soon...

Week 4 My final stand up...
